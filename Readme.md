This version of the code is simplified from the following github repo.

https://github.com/askmish/sawtooth-simplewallet

Developers who is working on mac, can find the benefits of this example. Since few sawtooth libraries are only
available in ubuntu, I am running those dependencies in the docker and the transaction processor and client will be 
running in the host.

Private keys can be generated using the utility. For this example, 2 privates keys have been generated and the
public key of second private key used to transfer the amount.
